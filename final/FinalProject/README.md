This is my final project for CSE 210. It is an open-ended project, where I created my own video game.
This project contains 10 different classes, each with their own purpose. It also demonstrates the principles
of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It does a lot of stuff, so I don't really
want to explain how it meets those here, and I did leave comments throughout my code, so you could probably
figure out how it meets all of those by looking through it.
This is completely written by me, with a little bit of help from ChatGPT for inspiration, for figuring out
good ways to perform some tasks, and for some bugfixing.

To get started, all you have to do is press the start button. It will give you different options for creating
a character, and then for directions to go, and for fighting enemies. The only things you might need to know
are some terms, such as HP, which stands for Health Points, and is how much damage your character can take.
The other possibly unfamiliar term is FP, which stands for Focus Points, which in other games is sometimes
referred to as SP (Skill Points), and it is used to use special skills, which will do more damage than a 
regular attack, and may do special effects.
There's not a lot of different options or paths, since this needs to be turned in, and pretty much everything 
that would be added would be just writing out descriptions and adding more if-statements, 
which doesn't seem as important to include for the final project, since I have all of the real code done, 
and that's really the important thing for a coding class.
